<h2>Do you know?</h2>

<p>Over the last couple of centuries, Earth has become warmer. Thatâ€™s because of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. </p>

<p>The most commonly known greenhouse gases is <b>carbon dioxide (CO2)</b>, a colourless and odourless gas that is released when fossil fuels are burnt. The carbon in the carbon dioxide will be stored for millions of years under the ground.</p>

<p>After carbon dioxide, the next most abundant greenhouse gas is <b>methane (CH4)</b>. Although methane is shorter-lived in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, <u>methane traps roughly 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide</u>. This makes methane a gas that is even more hazadous to our environment than carbon dioxide. </p>

<p><b>The beef and dairy industry is one of the main contributors to methane.</b> What cows eat has a big effect on how much methane they emit. Cows produces methane in two main ways: through digestion and through waste. Digesting certain types of food produces more methane than digesting other foods.</p>

<p>Methane gas emissions from livestock are a huge problem. Despite our countless efforts to drive less, save electricity, recycle, it may not be the most effective to mitigate climate change. Experts now believe that <u>eating less meat would actually have a bigger impact.</u></p>

<h2>It's not a lie!</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Cows produce 150 billion gallons of methane per day with methane. That's 25-100 times more destructive than CO2 on a 20 year time frame!</p></li>

<li><p>2,500 gallons of water are needed to produce 1 pound of beef and 1,000 gallons of water are required to produce 1 gallon of milk.</p></li>

<li><p>Worldwide, cows drink 45 billion gallons of water and eat 135 billion pounds of food each day.</p></li>

<li><p>We are currently growing enough food to feed 10 billion people.</p></li>

<li><p>Animal agriculture is responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation.</p></li>
</ul>
